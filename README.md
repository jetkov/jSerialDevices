# jSerialDevices

jSerialDevices is an extension of the jSerialComm library, defining serial communication protocols between Java and various serial devices, such as the Arduino or Raspberry PI (but currently only the Arduino is supported). 

The goal of the jSerialDevices is to create an easy way to access many different serial devices with Java, as well as support them across as many platforms as possible.
